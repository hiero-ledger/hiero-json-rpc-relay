# Implement APM Integration for Node.js Performance Monitoring

## Overview

The Hedera JSON-RPC Relay has robust K6 stress testing but lacks visibility into internal Node.js performance during tests. This ticket implements comprehensive Application Performance Monitoring (APM) using Clinic.js to provide deep insights into CPU usage, memory patterns, and async operations.

**Problem**: We can see external behavior (response times, errors) but not internal bottlenecks.
**Solution**: Integrate Clinic.js for professional Node.js performance analysis.

## Why Clinic.js?

[Clinic.js](https://clinicjs.org/) is the industry-standard toolkit for Node.js performance engineering:

- **Specialized Tools**: CPU profiling, memory analysis, async operations monitoring
- **Visual Dashboards**: Interactive flame graphs and performance visualizations
- **Production-Ready**: Battle-tested by enterprise Node.js applications
- **Complete Coverage**: All critical Node.js performance metrics in one toolkit

## Implementation Approach

### Clinic.js Toolkit Components

| Tool                | Focus            | Output                                                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `clinic flame`      | CPU Performance  | Interactive flame graphs showing function-level timing |
| `clinic doctor`     | System Health    | Memory, GC, I/O statistics with recommendations        |
| `clinic bubbleprof` | Async Operations | Event loop and async bottleneck analysis               |

### Performance Monitoring Workflow

```bash
# Install locally in k6 project
cd k6 && npm install --save-dev clinic

# Start monitored relay (example: CPU monitoring)
cd k6 && npm run start-monitored-relay:cpu

# Run stress test (separate terminal)
cd k6 && npm run stress-test

# Stop server (Ctrl+C) ‚Üí Generates interactive HTML reports
```
