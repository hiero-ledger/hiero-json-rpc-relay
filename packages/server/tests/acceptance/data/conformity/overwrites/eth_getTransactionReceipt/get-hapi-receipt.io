// gets the receipt for a HAPI (native Hedera) transaction
// HAPI transactions are submitted via the Hedera SDK (e.g., TransferTransaction)
// and appear as synthetic transactions in the relay.
//
// Key differences from Ethereum transactions:
// - type is null (not 0x0, 0x1, or 0x2)
// - from is the zero address
// - gasUsed and cumulativeGasUsed are 0x0
