// Reason for override: This test uses a smart contract that was predeployed by a transaction included in the
// chain.rlp block data: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/tests/chain.rlp

// Note: This is the original test file, modified for our test purposes: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/tests/eth_getLogs/no-topis.io

// WARNING!
// Hedera json rpc does not support null address, so deployed contract address 0xddfe287e55670b8bfb80d1f2d40c18d924fa0e31 sent instead.
// Hedera json rpc does not support null topics (WHICH THIS TEST IS ABOUT) so empty array is used instead.
